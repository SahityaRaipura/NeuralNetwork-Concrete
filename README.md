# NeuralNetwork-Concrete
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. 
The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients.
Given the variable name, variable type, and the measurement unit, we need to calculate the concrete compressive strength using neural networks.
